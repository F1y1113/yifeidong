I am a research assistant intern in University of Washington, supervised by Prof. [[Zhi-Qi Cheng](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhiqic/)]. Since 2023, I have also had the privilege of being guided by Prof. [[Alexander G Hauptmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Py54GcEAAAAJ&hl=en)] and Dr. [[Qi Dai](https://daiqi1989.github.io/)]. Prior to this, I spent two enriching years at Columbia University, where I worked with Prof. [[Ching-Yung Lin](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/content/ching-yung-lin)] and Prof. [[Henning Schulzrinne](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6IHX8J4AAAAJ&hl=en)]. Currently, my research interests focus on Embodied AI and foundational models, particularly in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) and human-aware social navigation.
