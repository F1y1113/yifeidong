I am a research assistant intern in University of Washington, supervised by Prof. [[Zhi-Qi Cheng](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhiqic/)]. Since 2023, I have also had the privilege of being guided by Prof. [[Alexander G Hauptmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Py54GcEAAAAJ&hl=en)] and Dr. [[Qi Dai](https://daiqi1989.github.io/)]. Prior to this, I spent two enriching years at Columbia University, where I worked with Prof. [[Ching-Yung Lin](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/content/ching-yung-lin)] and Prof. [[Henning Schulzrinne](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6IHX8J4AAAAJ&hl=en)]. Currently, my research interests focus on Embodied AI and foundational models, particularly in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) and human-aware social navigation.

## Hobbies
This section isn’t about my usual hobbies—traveling, badminton, or wine tasting (though I do love them). Instead, I want to focus on some of the more unique experiences I’ve had over the years. I co-founded a small startup with friends that turned a respectable profit in its first year, dove into trading (including futures, options, and crypto), and played through over 100,000 hands of poker. These ventures taught me the value of sound decision-making. I’m not afraid to take calculated risks if the expected return looks favorable, and I’m always prepared to put in the work to support my choices. This mindset has been pivotal in my research journey. I’m driven by the desire to make a real impact and motivated by challenges once deemed impossible.
